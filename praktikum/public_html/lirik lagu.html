Here is a little song I wrote<br/>
You might want to sing it note for note<br/>
Don't worry be happy<br/>
In every life we have some trouble<br/>
When you worry you make it double<br/>
Don't worry, be happy......<br/>
<font color ="yellow">
Ain't got no place to lay your head<br/>
Somebody came and took your bed<br/>
Don't worry, be happy<br/>
The land lord say your rent is late<br/>
He may have to litigate<br/>
Don't worry, be happy<br/>
Lood at me I am happy<br/>
Don't worry, be happy<br/>
Here I give you my phone number<br/>
When you worry call me<br/>
I make you happy<br/>
<font color="blue">
Don't worry, be happy<br/>
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style<br/>
Ain't got not girl to make you smile<br/>
But don't worry be happy<br/>
Cause when you worry<br/>
Your face will frown<br/>
And that will bring everybody down<br/>
So don't worry, be happy (now).....<br/>

There is this little song I wrote<br/>
I hope you learn it note for note<br/>
Like good little children<br/>
Don't worry, be happy<br/>
Listen to what I say<br/>
In your life expect some trouble<br/>
But when you worry<br/>
You make it double<br/>
Don't worry, be happy......<br/>
Don't worry don't do it, be happy<br/>
Put a smile on your face<br/>
Don't bring everybody down like this<br/>
Don't worry, it will soon past<br/>
Whatever it is<br/>
Don't worry, be happy<br/>
